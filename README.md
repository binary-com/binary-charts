```

To run unit tests:

```
npm test
```

For live rebuild during development:
```
webpack --watch
open example/index.html
```

## Usage

Install in your project:

```
npm i binary-charts --save
```

Render the component and pass ticks array to visualize:

```
<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} />
```

Ticks array is in a format [{ epoch, quote }]. Like:

```
var ticks = [
    { epoch: 123, quote: 95.4 },
    { epoch: 124, quote: 95.3 },
    { epoch: 125, quote: 95.6 }
];
```

 shiftMode | 'fixed' | only allowed `fixed` or `dynamic`, if `fixed`, no of data shown will be fix when new data is added, if `dynamic`, the scroller will expand when new data added
 ticks  | [ ]      | data for charts, can be in ticks structure or ohlc structure, check below for data shape
 theme | 'light'   | `light` or 'dark'
 type | 'area' | can be either `area` or `candlestick`, defines chart type
 onTypeChange | N/A | function with signature `(type) => void`, called when user change chart type **WIP**

## Ticks data structure
TICKS:
```
[
    {
        epoch: number,
        quote: number
    },
    ...
]
```

OHLC:
```
[
    {
        epoch: number,
        open: number,
        high: number,
        low: number,
        close: number,
    },
    ...
]
```


## Contract visualization

The component can optionally display the trade parameters or contract already bought.

```
<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} trade={trade} />
```
or

```
<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} contract={contract} />
```

Trade and contract properties have the exact format as accepted or returned by the API.

## Trading Times

<BinaryCharts ticks={ticks} tradingTimes={tradingTimes} />

You can optionally provide a trading times object and the Chart will display plot lines visialising open, close and settlement times.

## Dynamic data

Dynamically loading more data when needed by the chart will be available soon.

## Usage outside React projects

The project is currently lightly dependent on React, but will soon be usable without it. Until then, you can integrate a React component in non-React project like this:
